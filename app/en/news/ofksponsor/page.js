      <h1>ÖFK Sponsorship – A Step Closer to a Factory in Östersund</h1>
      <h4>2023-12-15</h4>
      <p>
        Production Yet to Begin, but Major Step Taken Toward Östersund Factory
        While production has not yet started, shares worth several million SEK
        were donated to help save ÖFK’s elite license. Now, the company behind
        the donation has taken a significant step toward establishing a factory
        in Östersund by securing a patent for its pain-relieving aspirin
        innovation. “The first product will be a wet wipe,” says Roar Adelsten,
        CEO of AUXESIS PHARMA HOLDING AB (publ).

        Adelsten and his partners visited Östersund during ÖFK’s final home
        match in Superettan. Although they didn’t have time to watch the game,
        they were introduced to the crowd before kickoff as the club’s financial
        saviors. In August, ÖFK announced that the club had received a donation
        of 110,000 shares in AUXESIS PHARMA HOLDING AB (publ), valued at 6
        million SEK. By selling most of the shares, the club was able to raise
        4.3 million SEK, a crucial amount for stabilizing its finances. Since
        then, Auxesis Pharma has been in regular contact with the municipality,
        working toward establishing production in Östersund.

        To manufacture pharmaceuticals, both patents and regulatory approval
        from the Swedish Medical Products Agency are required. Auxesis has now
        secured the patent. “We have registered the active components,” confirms
        Roar Adelsten, CEO of the newly established company. The core innovation
        involves stabilizing pain-relieving aspirin, which traditionally
        dissolves in effervescent tablets. Instead, Auxesis aims to develop a
        method for applying the medication directly to the skin. While earlier
        discussions mentioned an ointment, the first product to be released will
        be a wet wipe. “For example, if you get stung by nettles or burn
        yourself while baking during the holiday season, our product provides
        quick relief. We are also targeting minor burns, such as sunburns,”
        Adelsten explains. With the patent now registered, the company is
        searching for a contract manufacturer to produce the wet wipes on a
        small scale. Alternatively, production may take place in laboratories at
        the Karolinska Institute, where the company has access to facilities.

        The next step is testing the product on humans and applying for market
        approval from the Swedish Medical Products Agency. “By the end of the
        year, we will decide whether to rent an existing facility in Östersund
        or build a new one from scratch. We have looked at several locations,
        but the requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing are strict. Owning
        the facility ourselves would be an advantage, but no final decision has
        been made yet,” says Roar Adelsten.
