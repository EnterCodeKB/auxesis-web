      <h1>CEO's Statement – Spring 2025</h1>
      <h4>2025-04-14</h4>
      <h3>
        Auxesis Pharma is moving forward – with science, innovation, and
        confidence in the future
      </h3>
      <p className={styles.ptext}>
        During the spring, Auxesis Pharma has continued its intensive efforts to
        develop an effective product for pain relief. The focus has been on
        improving the product’s solubility, skin penetration, and stability.
        These factors are critical in creating a safe and effective
        pharmaceutical formulation. To ensure the highest quality, we have
        partnered with leading Swedish laboratories specializing in topical
        (skin-based) medications.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.ptext}>
        We are now approaching an important milestone – submitting documentation
        to the Swedish Medical Products Agency to initiate clinical trials. A
        key part of this process is demonstrating stable and reproducible
        results from our studies.
      </p>
      <h3>The Patent Process and New Opportunities</h3>
      <p className={styles.ptext}>
        Our efforts to secure intellectual property rights are progressing
        steadily. We are currently in dialogue with the European Patent Office
        (EPO), responding to their standard questions as we prepare for the next
        stage of the process. In parallel, we are continuously exploring new
        potential applications where our treatment could have a meaningful
        impact – for instance, in the area of burn injuries.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.ptext}>
        ASA.P, our active substance, has shown promising potential in relieving
        burn-related pain. For this reason, we have established contact with
        both Swedish and international burn units and experts to better
        understand the clinical needs and the possible pathway toward developing
        a targeted treatment in this area.
      </p>
      <h3>Enhanced Capabilities and Brand Clarity</h3>
      <p className={styles.ptext}>
        We have begun work on developing Auxesis Pharma’s visual identity – an
        important step in clarifying our brand. A strong visual profile enhances
        our external credibility and strengthens our appeal to investors,
        partners, and the healthcare sector.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.ptext}>
        During the first quarter, we successfully completed a share issue that
        brought in SEK 6.7 million and approximately 85 new shareholders. The
        issue was finalized at the end of March and is currently under review by
        auditors before registration with the Swedish Companies Registration
        Office (Bolagsverket). Once completed, the shares will be transferred to
        the respective shareholders' accounts.
      </p>
      <h3>Maintaining Stability Amid Global Uncertainty</h3>
      <p className={styles.ptext}>
        Despite the current global financial uncertainty, the pharmaceutical
        sector continues to be viewed as stable and long-term. Auxesis Pharma is
        not currently affected by the recent market turbulence. Our operations
        are grounded in a clear strategy focused on development in Sweden and
        future launch in the Nordic region and Europe. We remain committed to
        working methodically and purposefully in line with our established plan.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.ptext}>
        I look forward to the continued journey with confidence, and our next
        newsletter is scheduled for release before the summer. Thank you to all
        shareholders, partners, and colleagues who contribute to the development
        of Auxesis Pharma.
      </p>
