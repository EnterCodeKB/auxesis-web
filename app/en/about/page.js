          TO REDEFINE THE PHARMACEUTICAL CATEGORY OF PAIN AND SKIN IRRITATION

        <div>
          <p className={styles.ptext}>
            Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is one of the most well-known substances
            for pain relief and has been used in pharmaceuticals since the late
            19th century, including in Treo, Bamyl, and Aspirin.
          </p>

          <p className={styles.ptext}>
            After years of research and thousands of trials, Auxesis, together
            with Professor Moustapha Hassan and his team, has achieved what no
            one else has before: stabilizing ASA in liquid form.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.ptext}>
            With ASA in liquid form, there are new possibilities to develop
            entirely new formulations that can be easily applied directly to the
            skin, eliminating pain or irritation within minutes by blocking the
            pain signal to the brain. By adding other pharmaceutically active
            substances, the effect is maintained until the body has healed
            itself. Studies indicate that ASA.P remains on the skin and does not
            enter the bloodstream.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.ptext}>
            Based on proprietary patents, Auxesis is the first to develop
            innovative and accessible pharmaceuticals that not only relieve but
            rapidly eliminate pain and irritation on the skin.
