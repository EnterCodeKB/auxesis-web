                <p className={styles.ptext}>
                  Building on its own patents, Auxesis develops innovative
                  pharmaceuticals that effectively relieve pain and skin
                  irritation. The products are easy to use and accessible to
                  both consumers and professional sectors. After years of
                  research and thousands of tests, Auxesis, in collaboration
                  with the research team at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm,
                  has achieved something unique: stabilizing acetylsalicylic
                  acid (ASA) in liquid form. This stabilization, combined with
                  other already approved pharmaceuticals, enables direct
                  application to the skin.

                  In the summer of 2025, the company will celebrate 10 years.
                  Since its inception, Auxesis has evolved from an initial idea
                  through research and capitalization to preclinical testing and
                  global PCT patent protection. The goal is to achieve approval
                  for the groundbreaking product ASA.P® by 2026, followed by a
                  public listing. Currently, Auxesis has two globally registered
                  trademarks: ASA.P® and CoxyPet®.
